Using OpenAI's GPT-3 API, this app creates a stereotypical LinkedIn post (attributes include over-exaggeration, unrelated inspirational quotes, etc.) based on a prompt from the user.

## Try it yourself

Add your API key OpenAI.com in a .env.local file.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
